# Two Pointer

## What is Two Pointer?

Two pointer is a technique for manipulating arrays and strings that consists of creating two pointers, one for the beginning and one for the and of the array or 
string to manipulate this data in a performative way. This technique allows to have more free memory in your code, because we only have **two pointers** in the memory pointing to the same element.
